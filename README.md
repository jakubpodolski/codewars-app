## codewars-app

This app utilizes codewars.com api that provides information about user.
Information is fetched and then presented using React and Bootstrap (where needed styles have been altered).
User can be also added to favorites (list of favorite users is kept in localstorage)

The tests were written using jest and enzyme.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
